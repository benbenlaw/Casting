Dramatically improved performance of the controller.


2.2.4
Fixed Equipment Modifier not allowing for more than one item in the upgrade slot
Fixed Jets translation
Fixed Protection modifier crashing when taking damage
Fixed Jets Modifier needing 8000mb of Molten Blaze instead of 720mb
Updated Jets and Soulbound textures thanks @Yuki

2.2.3
Fixed soulbound not removing the items from the deaths

2.2.2
Fixed protection, lavawalker and waterwalker crashing the game when modifier is on
Potentially fixed other modifiers that may have had the same issue
Added Soulbound, applies to all default tools and armors, uses Molten Soul, if you die that item will now return to your inventory on respawn
Changed beheading to use 1 skull instead of Molten Soul in its recipe
Added Jets, applied to boots, leggings and chestplates, uses Molten Blaze, each level increase the jet speed into the air, up to 5 levels,
    config can be as high as you want, cooldown and block amount per level can be set in the config. Custom modifier tiers allows for helmet to be used as well
    but not by default

2.2.1
Fixed ignite tooltip being wrong and data component using boolean instead of int

2.2.0
Major refactor of equipment modifiers, changes to how modifiers are added into the mod, this should allow for easier addition of new modifiers in the future
Equipment modifier now only allows a single item in the tool and output slot
Added new config, custom_modifier_sets, this allows you to create a custom set of modifiers that can be added to tools and armor see custom_modifier_sets.json
    for more information

2.1.4
Fixed Casting scene not loading in guide me
Added wire mold to the casting guide me page

2.1.3
Lava Walker and Water Walker now use "casting:effected_by_lava_walker" and "casting:effected_by_water_walker" tags instead of Water and lava blocks. This allows for more customization of the blocks that can be walked on
    both modifiers to be customized to allow more blocks to be walked on for both
My Nether Delight Seagrass, Kelp and Tall Seagrass are now added to the "casting:effected_by_lava_walker" tag
Fixed Player Bob when using the Lava Walker modifier

2.1.2
Magnet modifier now only places broken blocks into the players inventory if the block is broken with a TieredTool eg pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe, paxel ore sword
This should fix a bunch of issue with custom items using there own block breaking logic that the magnet modifier was overriding
Confirm fixes Mekanism Cardboard Box, Construction Sticks (Replacing) and Building Gadgets (Exchanging) but this should fix 99% of the issues with the magnet modifier

2.1.1
Fixed Multiblock Mixer crashing when trying to shift click items into it, now returns empty item stack not null
Night Vision, Flight, Step Assist, Water Walker, Lava Walker, Speed and Magnet modifiers can no be enabled/ disabled. This works differently to the tools. Each
    armor slot has a keybind (not set by default) that can be used to toggle the modifier on and off whilst equipped. The keybind works in game and inside screens
    allows for more user friendliness. These modifier now have a tooltip to show it can be disabled
Excavation Modifier Changes;
    Now shows outline of blocks that will be broken when excavation is used
    Now mines slower depending on the level, reduce based on this calculation ( excavationLevel + (event.getOriginalSpeed() / 4) )
Maybe fixed double sounds when using casting tools

2.1.0
The max amount of items in the multiblock controller is now config based
The max Fluid amount in the multiblock controller is now config based
Both of these changes are with the intention of allowing for more slots in the multiblock controller in the future
Added direct guide me support for multiblocks, basic casting stuff and the equipment modifier
    This is a work in progress and will be expanded in the future any help with this is appreciated

2.0.32
Fixed enriched iron recipe not producing the correct amount of molten enriched iron

2.0.31
Improved logic of water and lava walker to check player position, this fixes glitching with one block spaces above the player

2.0.30
Actually fixed solidifier recipes for enriched quartz

2.0.29
Fixed solidifier recipes for enriched quartz

2.0.28
Disabled some debug messages
Added Molten Quartz Enriched Iron (Refined Storage)

2.0.27
Fixed modified pickaxes and swords not taking damage when used regardless of the unbreaking modifier

2.0.26
Controllers now actually check the amount of fuel in the tank before processing a recipe,
    fixes issues with recipe being processed and no fuel being used when the fuel level is below the minimum needed
Solidifiers now actually check the amount of coolant in the tank before processing a recipe,
    fixes issues with recipe speeds not being reset back to there original if the fluid tank contained a below minimum coolant amount
Player places molds in the Solidifier now only stack to 1
Blocks that drop experience when broken now drop experience when broken with tools with casting modifier, except for silk touch
Disabled log for direction when using excavation modifier
Completely reworked the unbreaking modifier, this now uses a mixin instead of checking for specific event like block breaking and armor damage.
This means that any tool or armor that has the unbreaking modifier will now have the chance of no damage across all events both nin vanilla, casting and other mods
Example 1, Night Vision helmet with unbreaking 10 will never take damage from the night vision effect
Stuff confirmed to now work with the unbreaking modifier;
    Hoeing crops
    Stripping logs
    Swords dealing damage to mobs
    Other Casting Modifiers that deal damage to a tool on use
Fixed non modified armour not having its armor values applied when taking damage
Looting modifier will no be triggered on the Wither Boss, for whatever reason this mob doesnt have a loot table so casting creates an empty one which
    clears all drops, now casting will not create the loot table and full back to vanilla dropCustom method, this should also fix the cognizant drop from
    Mystical Agriculture

2.0.25
Fixed experience having effect on the main output of the recipe

2.0.24
Added Molten Experience
This is obtained when smelting certain items such as ores and raw materials inside the multiblock controller
This is currently controlled by adding the items to the "casting:melting_produces_experience" tag
The amount given is inside the casting config, default is 25
Molten Experience can be used to make Bottle o' Enchanting in the Solidifier
Molten Experience can be used to increase a tools level by 1, this works like other modifiers but doesn't require a free slot to use,
    the tools experience is preserved the tool simply gains a level up to the max

2.0.23
Added missing repair mold translation

2.0.22
Fixed Regulator not having a tool asigned to it

2.0.21
Fixed Valve crashing when shift clicking items (there is no item handler for players to access in teh valve)
Multiblock mixer no longer processes a recipe when the output tank is too full
Multi Tank now saves regulator information, this means that valves no longer ignore regulation upon world reloads
Valve fluid handler now updates correctly when the controller is moved / replaced
Added all equipment modifier to the "casting:equipment_modifiers" tag
Fixed missing model files for feather falling

2.0.20
Looting modifier now parses the player correctly enabling for player only drops working like blaze rods
Fixed beheading modifier not being read on the server side leading to missing head drops
Disabled log for head drops

2.0.19
Fixed Valves crashing when trying to connect to item or fluid handlers when the controller is not present
Updated textures thanks @Yuki

2.0.18
Added Multiblock Regulator, when more than 1 is added to a multiblock controller will reserver space in the output tank for a set amount of fluids
EG if there is 4 regulators in the structure the shared fluid tank will reserver 1/4 of the total tank size for each of the fluids
This should allow for even more efficiency and control over the controller
Block has no GUI
Having one or none keeps the original behavior of the shared tank to smelt everything it can
Added Feather Falling modifier applies to boots, uses feathers, increase amount of percentage of damage by 10% per level, up to 5 levels,
    config up to 8, 80% cap of damage, each level deals an addition damage on the boots when landing

2.0.17
Removed adjacent tank rendering for the equipment modifier
Valve is now using the controller filtered item handler correct, fixes oversending of items

Quartz block now creates 1000mb of molten quartz instead of 360mb
All vanilla quartz can be melted down into molten quartz
Added Molten Black Quartz, from actually additions
Fixed original casting block dump fluid translation being missing
Fixed Dump Fluid tooltip, tooltip now always shows when hovering over the fluid area
Fixed equipment modifier error messages missing there translations
Fixed auto smelt information
Tool that could be disabled with shift now use a toggle instead. This shows inside the tool tip of the tool
This spits the modifier that can be disabled with shift into two this and the new toggle version
Silk touch, auto smelt and excavation are now toggleable
These work as normal then when enabled/ disabled the tooltip will show a tick or a cross respectively

2.0.9

Fixed equipment modifier not showing the hold shift for more information tool tip

2.0.7
Fixed Molten Black Brick color
Added coal ore processing
Recipes like ores that have a bonus output amount now show there non bonus amount in JEI but adds a * to show that there is a bonus output
In these tooltips in JEI it will now show the Multiblock Controller output amount and the Simple Controller output amount if there is a difference
Simple Controller do not get bonus output amounts only the Multiblock Controller
Fixed disconnects happening sometimes with a multiblock is formed (maybe anyway)
Disabled logging of fluid handler capacity
Added multiblock not found error message
Controller Filtering;
Controller now has a filter button, clicking this will only allows items in the current slot to be added to the controller via automation
This does not prevent the player placing items into the controller inside the filtered slots, if used these slots will still retain there filter
Clicking the button again clears the filter
Filtered slots will show grayed out icon in the GUI

2.0.6
Re Run data generation to black bricks

2.0.5
Fixed Multiblock loot tables

2.0.4
Disabled some debugging

Combined Equipment modifiers into casting creative tab
Renamed - Solidifier to Simple Solidifier, Controller to Simple Controller, Mixer to Simple Mixer, Tank to Simple Tank
    Mixer Whisk to Simple Mixer Whisk and Equipment Modifier to Simple Equipment Modifier
These "Simple" block function exactly the same as 1.17.18 and the name change is a translation not the actual block name keeping compatibility with existing worlds
Added Coolant Recipe, this is a split from the original fuel recipes to allow for more customization of the fuel and coolant
Solidifier now check the Coolant Recipe in adjacent tanks to determine the speed of the solidifier
All common resource gear, rods, plates ect can now all be re melted down into molten fluid
Added Molten Ruby, Peridot and Sapphire
Added error messages to the controller
Fixed fuel tank missing translation
Progress inside the controller now reset when an item is changed
Solidifier, valve and mixer now clear there memory when the controller is broken preventing the shared tank being used with no controller
Valve item handler not works when world is reopened
Solidifier can now set the FLUID when switched off
Original casting blocks tool SHIFT tooltip now only shows when there is additional information to show
Fluids now tagged to common "c" tag for additional compatibility with other mods
Ender pearl now melts to 250mb instead of 80mb, recipes adjusted accordingly
Added molten black bricks, provides a more efficient way to make black bricks
Added bricks to black bricks smelting recipe
Tweaked value of fuels and added coolants
Fixed End Steel recipe
Fluid name look slighting different due to the new fluid registry system, textures will be adjusted with updated tints in the future
Fuels now require a duration in there recipe, the duration set that duration to the controller from the multiblock fuel tank
Added Black Brick Glass
Most of the mod uses data generation for recipes, lang and more, tooltips are now named following vanilla standards

//JEI Changes
All JEI categories now use the correct slot texture instead of a de-saturated version
Mixer now shows the fluid amount on the fluid stack instead of text above, has space for 12 input fluids
melting - switched the temp and heat, added this information to the fluid stack

//Multiblock Controller - BETA
This whole multiblock system is in BETA, please report any bugs you find

Added Multiblock Controller, a new controller that supports multiblock, must use black bricks/ black brick glass to build the multiblock
Max radius is 1000 blocks with pretty much any dimensions
Bigger internal volume the bigger the new Shared Tank will be (up to 1,000,000mb), Usable slots also increase with the size of the multiblock (up to 60)
Multiblock Controller speed, the default is now up to 1000, note this has no effect on usage this is just a default max value if modpack devs want to make it slower
This removes having to calculating the speed of the controller based on the fuel used, note this speed calculation is still used for the Simple Controller
The multiblock valid blocks are tag driven allowing for basically any block you want to add, this include a wall and a floor tag if modpack dev wish to change that
    "casting:controller_walls", "casting:controller_floor" respectively. By default black bricks can be used for both

Added Multiblock Fuel Tank, this is the fuel used to melt item in the controller, uses the same fuels as the Simple Tank, must be part of the multiblock.
    Has GUI to collect buckets and insert buckets into the tank

Added Multiblock Solidifier, this Solidifier works like the original solidifier but uses fluids inside the Mulitblock Controller, must be part of the multiblock to work,
    can be filtered to only use a certain fluid in its recipes, can be piped into and out of
Solidifier default speed is now 300 ticks without coolant this is to encourage the use of coolants

Added Multiblock Coolant Tank, this is the coolant used to cool the Solidifier, uses the same coolants as the Simple Tank, must be part of the Multiblock Controller to effect the
    Solidifier speed. Has GUI to collect buckets and insert buckets into the tank

Added Multiblock Valve, used to input and output into the sharded tank inside the multiblock, can be filtered to only allow that fluid in and out, Also can be used
    to insert items into the controller item handler

Added Multiblock mixer, this replaces the old mixer and allows for the mixing of fluids inside the multiblock, the mixer will list alloys that you can craft
    inside the mixer, cycle through the alloys to select the one you want to craft. The mixer must be set to craft the alloy

Added oreMultiplied config, changing this edits the amount of molten fluid from ores by 1.5x by default, effected recipe inputs can be added to the new
    "casting:melting_output_amount_effected" tag, this contains ores and raw materials by default and raw storage blocks

- Holding shift prevents excavation from being applied
Holding shift will now stop silk touch, auto smelt and step assist from activating
Added Night Vision applies to helmets, uses golden carrots, takes damage every 600 ticks, can be changed in config
Added Water Breathing applies to helmets, uses pufferfish, takes damage every 100 ticks when in water, can be changed in config
