Changelog BBL Casting

// TODO //
Make item show there contents (1.22)
fishing rods support for tool modifiers (1.22)
Add experience to melting recipe (1.22), maybe even expand melting to allow multiple fluids from a single item

2.0.30
Actually fixed solidifier recipes for enriched quartz

2.0.29
Fixed solidifier recipes for enriched quartz

2.0.28
Disabled some debug messages
Added Molten Quartz Enriched Iron (Refined Storage)

2.0.27
Fixed modified pickaxes and swords not taking damage when used regardless of the unbreaking modifier

2.0.26
Controllers now actually check the amount of fuel in the tank before processing a recipe,
    fixes issues with recipe being processed and no fuel being used when the fuel level is below the minimum needed
Solidifiers now actually check the amount of coolant in the tank before processing a recipe,
    fixes issues with recipe speeds not being reset back to there original if the fluid tank contained a below minimum coolant amount
Player places molds in the Solidifier now only stack to 1
Blocks that drop experience when broken now drop experience when broken with tools with casting modifier, except for silk touch
Disabled log for direction when using excavation modifier
Completely reworked the unbreaking modifier, this now uses a mixin instead of checking for specific event like block breaking and armor damage.
This means that any tool or armor that has the unbreaking modifier will now have the chance of no damage across all events both nin vanilla, casting and other mods
Example 1, Night Vision helmet with unbreaking 10 will never take damage from the night vision effect
Stuff confirmed to now work with the unbreaking modifier;
    Hoeing crops
    Stripping logs
    Swords dealing damage to mobs
    Other Casting Modifiers that deal damage to a tool on use
Fixed non modified armour not having its armor values applied when taking damage
Looting modifier will no be triggered on the Wither Boss, for whatever reason this mob doesnt have a loot table so casting creates an empty one which
    clears all drops, now casting will not create the loot table and full back to vanilla dropCustom method, this should also fix the cognizant drop from
    Mystical Agriculture

2.0.25
Fixed experience having effect on the main output of the recipe

2.0.24
Added Molten Experience
This is obtained when smelting certain items such as ores and raw materials inside the multiblock controller
This is currently controlled by adding the items to the "casting:melting_produces_experience" tag
The amount given is inside the casting config, default is 25
Molten Experience can be used to make Bottle o' Enchanting in the Solidifier
Molten Experience can be used to increase a tools level by 1, this works like other modifiers but doesn't require a free slot to use,
    the tools experience is preserved the tool simply gains a level up to the max

2.0.23
Added missing repair mold translation

2.0.22
Fixed Regulator not having a tool asigned to it

2.0.21
Fixed Valve crashing when shift clicking items (there is no item handler for players to access in teh valve)
Multiblock mixer no longer processes a recipe when the output tank is too full
Multi Tank now saves regulator information, this means that valves no longer ignore regulation upon world reloads
Valve fluid handler now updates correctly when the controller is moved / replaced
Added all equipment modifier to the "casting:equipment_modifiers" tag
Fixed missing model files for feather falling

2.0.20
Looting modifier now parses the player correctly enabling for player only drops working like blaze rods
Fixed beheading modifier not being read on the server side leading to missing head drops
Disabled log for head drops

2.0.19
Fixed Valves crashing when trying to connect to item or fluid handlers when the controller is not present
Updated textures thanks @Yuki

2.0.18
Added Multiblock Regulator, when more than 1 is added to a multiblock controller will reserver space in the output tank for a set amount of fluids
EG if there is 4 regulators in the structure the shared fluid tank will reserver 1/4 of the total tank size for each of the fluids
This should allow for even more efficiency and control over the controller
Block has no GUI
Having one or none keeps the original behavior of the shared tank to smelt everything it can
Added Feather Falling modifier applies to boots, uses feathers, increase amount of percentage of damage by 10% per level, up to 5 levels,
    config up to 8, 80% cap of damage, each level deals an addition damage on the boots when landing

Simple Controller do not get bonus output amounts only the Multiblock Controller
Fixed disconnects happening sometimes with a multiblock is formed (maybe anyway)
Disabled logging of fluid handler capacity
Added multiblock not found error message
Controller Filtering;
Controller now has a filter button, clicking this will only allows items in the current slot to be added to the controller via automation
This does not prevent the player placing items into the controller inside the filtered slots, if used these slots will still retain there filter
Clicking the button again clears the filter
Filtered slots will show grayed out icon in the GUI

2.0.6
Re Run data generation to black bricks

2.0.5
Fixed Multiblock loot tables

Added molten black bricks, provides a more efficient way to make black bricks
Added bricks to black bricks smelting recipe
Tweaked value of fuels and added coolants
Fixed End Steel recipe
Fluid name look slighting different due to the new fluid registry system, textures will be adjusted with updated tints in the future

//JEI Changes
All JEI categories now use the correct slot texture instead of a de-saturated version
Mixer now shows the fluid amount on the fluid stack instead of text above, has space for 12 input fluids
melting - switched the temp and heat, added this information to the fluid stack

//Multiblock Controller - BETA
This whole multiblock system is in BETA, please report any bugs you find

Added Multiblock Controller, a new controller that supports multiblock, must use black bricks/ black brick glass to build the multiblock
Max radius is 1000 blocks with pretty much any dimensions
Bigger internal volume the bigger the new Shared Tank will be (up to 1,000,000mb), Usable slots also increase with the size of the multiblock (up to 60)
Multiblock Controller speed, the default is now up to 1000, note this has no effect on usage this is just a default max value if modpack devs want to make it slower
This removes having to calculating the speed of the controller based on the fuel used, note this speed calculation is still used for the Simple Controller
The multiblock valid blocks are tag driven allowing for basically any block you want to add, this include a wall and a floor tag if modpack dev wish to change that
    "casting:controller_walls", "casting:controller_floor" respectively. By default black bricks can be used for both

Added Multiblock Fuel Tank, this is the fuel used to melt item in the controller, uses the same fuels as the Simple Tank, must be part of the multiblock.
    Has GUI to collect buckets and insert buckets into the tank

Added Multiblock Solidifier, this Solidifier works like the original solidifier but uses fluids inside the Mulitblock Controller, must be part of the multiblock to work,
    can be filtered to only use a certain fluid in its recipes, can be piped into and out of
Solidifier default speed is now 300 ticks without coolant this is to encourage the use of coolants

Added Multiblock Coolant Tank, this is the coolant used to cool the Solidifier, uses the same coolants as the Simple Tank, must be part of the Multiblock Controller to effect the
    Solidifier speed. Has GUI to collect buckets and insert buckets into the tank

Added Multiblock Valve, used to input and output into the sharded tank inside the multiblock, can be filtered to only allow that fluid in and out, Also can be used
    to insert items into the controller item handler

Added Multiblock mixer, this replaces the old mixer and allows for the mixing of fluids inside the multiblock, the mixer will list alloys that you can craft
    inside the mixer, cycle through the alloys to select the one you want to craft. The mixer must be set to craft the alloy

Added oreMultiplied config, changing this edits the amount of molten fluid from ores by 1.5x by default, effected recipe inputs can be added to the new
    "casting:melting_output_amount_effected" tag, this contains ores and raw materials by default and raw storage blocks
